I've added 5 new video sections

Hi Coders,

I'm excited to announce the addition of 5 new videos to my online starter kit walkthrough:

Next.js Project Structure Walkthrough: Dive deep into the project structure, including the data access layer, util files, components, use cases, and app directory.

Layered Architecture: Learn about layered architecture, its benefits, and how it's implemented in the project.

Setting Up Authentication: Get step-by-step instructions on setting up authentication, including OAuth and email/password auth.

Setting Up Stripe: Understand how to integrate Stripe into your project, manage subscription upgrades, handle expired subscriptions, use the Stripe customer portal, and create products.

Cloudflare R2 Setup: See how to set up Cloudflare R2 for image storage and integrate it with your code.

These videos will help you understand not only how to set up some of these necessary third-party services but also how the code base integrates with them. Understanding how a larger code base works is sometimes very hard to do without a helping hand. I'm happy to be there to guide you!
