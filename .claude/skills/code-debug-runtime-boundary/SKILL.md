description: Internal handoff target invoked by fix-bug when a failure crosses process or runtime boundaries — Electron vs Node, browser vs server, dev server vs packaged app, worker vs main thread, CLI vs app runtime, native modules, ABI mismatch, preload script, IPC boundary, SSR vs client bundle, electron-rebuild, postinstall, or NODE_MODULE_VERSION errors. Traces which process actually loads the failing code before changing libraries, scripts, or rebuild commands. Trigger phrases for routing: "NODE_MODULE_VERSION", "electron-rebuild", "preload", "main vs renderer", "ABI mismatch", "native module not found", "works in dev fails packaged".

# Code Debug Runtime Boundary

> **Core mindset:** Identify the runtime that owns the failing dependency or side effect before changing libraries, scripts, or rebuild commands.

Use this skill when a bug crosses process or runtime boundaries.

## Triggers

Apply this workflow when the user reports:

- A UI action failing because of server, database, filesystem, native module, or CLI behavior.
- Errors mentioning runtime-specific loading, native bindings, module versions, bundled apps, workers, preload scripts, or dev servers.
- Confusion about whether code runs in the browser, server, Electron main process, renderer, worker, package runtime, or local CLI.
- A bug that reappears after restart, reinstall, rebuild, packaging, or switching between dev and production.

## Workflow

1. **Map the call chain.** Name the failing user action, trace it across every boundary crossing (UI event → fetch/IPC/worker message/spawned process → DB/FS/native call), and label each hop with its runtime (browser renderer, Electron main/preload, Vite dev server, Node server, `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` child, web worker, service worker, packaged app server).

2. **Pin the runtime that actually loads the failing code.** At the suspected load site, prove it with a runtime probe rather than guessing from imports:
   - Node vs Electron: log `process.versions.node` and `process.versions.electron` (only the latter is set inside Electron).
   - Electron main vs renderer vs preload: check `process.type` (`'browser'` = main, `'renderer'`, `'worker'`, or `undefined`).
   - Browser vs server bundle: `typeof window === 'undefined'`, `import.meta.env.SSR`, or framework equivalents (`'use server'`, Next.js `headers()` boundary).
   - Worker vs main thread: `typeof WorkerGlobalScope !== 'undefined'` or the Node `worker_threads` `isMainThread`.
   - Which binary launched it: inspect the parent process and the actual path of `node`/`electron`/`bun` on `PATH`; module ABI mismatches almost always trace here.

3. **Compare dev vs production boot paths.** Read both entry scripts in `package.json` and any builder config. Note differences in launcher (`vite`, `electron .`, `node dist/...`, `electron-forge start` vs packaged binary), `main`/`exports` fields, env (`NODE_ENV`, `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`), and which files each path actually loads. Same logical module can resolve to different files.

4. **Inspect boundary-blurring scripts and config.** Flag: `npm rebuild`/`electron-rebuild` targeting the wrong ABI, server-only modules pulled into a client bundle, preload scripts exposing privileged APIs over IPC, conditional `exports` (`node`/`browser`/`electron`) picking the wrong subpath, externalized vs bundled deps in the production build.

5. **Fix the ownership boundary first.** Align the script/runtime with the intended architecture before reaching for retries, reinstalls, broad fallbacks, or library swaps. If two runtimes legitimately need the dep, treat it as an architecture decision (see Decision Guide).

## Decision Guide

- If the browser or renderer initiates the action but an API route performs the side effect, debug the API runtime.
- If Electron main or preload imports the failing dependency directly, debug the Electron runtime.
- If a worker imports the failing dependency, debug the worker's build target and runtime.
- If dev and production run different server entries, verify both paths intentionally load the same dependencies.
- If one dependency is loaded by multiple runtimes, treat it as an architecture decision: split ownership, use separate build outputs, or choose a dependency that supports both runtimes.

### When the path can't be fully traced

If the call chain disappears into a bundle, dynamic `require`, IPC, or third-party code:

1. **Instrument the boundaries instead of reading code.** Add a top-level log at each candidate load site that prints the runtime probes from Workflow step 2 (`process.versions`, `process.type`, `typeof window`, `__filename`/`import.meta.url`). Run the failing action; the first probe that fires is the owner.
2. **Diff the resolved module.** `require.resolve()` (Node) or check the bundle output for the exact path actually loaded — `exports` conditions and bundler aliases often resolve the same import to different files in different runtimes.
3. **If still ambiguous,** stop debugging the symptom and re-read the launcher: which binary started this process, with which `cwd`, env, and entry file. The boundary is almost always defined there, not at the failure site.

## Output Format

When reporting findings, keep the answer concrete:

```text
User action:
Execution path:
Runtime that loads the failing code:
Boundary mismatch:
Recommended fix:
```

Add a short "why this keeps happening" explanation when the bug recurs after rebuilds, restarts, installs, or packaging.

**Example (better-sqlite3 in an Electron app):**

```text
User action:           Clicking "Save" in the renderer throws "was compiled against a different Node.js version".
Execution path:        Renderer click → IPC `db:save` → Electron main → require('better-sqlite3') → native .node load.
Runtime that loads:    Electron main process (Electron 30, Node ABI 123), confirmed by process.versions.electron at the require site.
Boundary mismatch:     `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` ran under system Node (ABI 115), so the .node binary targets the wrong ABI.
Recommended fix:       Replace `npm rebuild` with `electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3` (or `@electron/rebuild`) in the postinstall script.
Why it keeps happening: Every `npm install` reruns postinstall under system Node, silently undoing the Electron rebuild.
```

## Avoid

- Do not assume the visible layer is the failing runtime — the UI surfaces the error, but the side effect (DB write, file read, native call) usually executes one or more boundaries away.
- Do not recommend reinstalling or rebuilding before identifying which runtime needs the artifact — `npm rebuild` compiles native modules against whichever Node ABI invoked it, which is often not the Electron ABI that will actually load them, so the rebuild "fixes" the wrong target.
- Do not blame a library until the runtime boundary and ownership path are clear — most "library bugs" in this class are really the right library loaded by the wrong runtime.
- Do not collapse dev and production behavior into one explanation when boot paths differ — dev typically runs through a dev server (Vite, tsx, electron + vite) while production runs a bundled entry, and they can import entirely different files for the same logical module.
